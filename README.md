# Description
I designed and developed a React application aimed at generating random wallpaper images. Alongside providing image generation, the application furnishes details about each image, including the location and place where it was captured. The backend functionality is powered by an API, facilitating the seamless generation of images. The project was crafted using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience.

# Initialize a demo project locally
1. Initialize a vite-pages project (with npm 7+):
    execute npm init vite-pages app-demo -- --template app to initialize an app project, or
    execute npm init vite-pages library-demo -- --template lib to initialize a library project, or
    execute npm init vite-pages library-monorepo-demo -- --template lib-monorepo to initialize a library project with monorepo setup.
    If you are using npm 6.x, the extra double-dash before --template should be deleted. For example, npm init vite-pages app-demo --template app.
2. npm install
3. npm run dev and play with the local dev environment.
4. npm run build.
5. npm run ssr. You can disable javascript in your browser, to  verify if it can still render.
